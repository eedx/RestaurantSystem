# RestaurantSystem
In this repo there's a simple, yet useful system for restaurants billing control, with two main columns:
* Food, beverage and dessert selection (with amount specification)
* Calculator

It allows the user to calculate, generate and save a receipt, showing the amounts and total costs

For editing the prices and different options, the main variables are precios_* (prices of food, drinks and desserts), 
and lista_* (the actual list of selectable options)
